This is the website for The MQ, UCSD's premier satire newspaper. We use:

- Rails 4.2.0
- Pure
- MySQL
- DigitalOcean

All work should be done in branches off of staging and put up for review
via PRs into staging; staging gets merged into master for releases.

If you want to **contribute** to code, report a bug, or just
need someone to be there for a little while, email me at web-editor@themq.org.
