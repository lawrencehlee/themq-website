This is the website for The MQ, UCSD's premier satire newspaper.
We run Rails 4.2.0. There's not that much to this app besides displaying
info, so don't expect much.
All work should be done in branches off of staging and put up for review
via PRs into staging. Staging gets merged into master for releases.

If you want to **contribute** to code, email us at web-editor@themq.org.

If you want to file a bug, submit an issue or email us at web-editor@themq.org.
We would prefer it if you submitted issues, but that's okay.
