Area Student Karen Lendel bade farewell to her internship, which she described as “a dream,” as a quality control agent in the recently integrated PornHub & Jerry’s company.

Lendel’s position came from the recent acquisition of the online pornography juggernaut PornHub by ice cream manufacturer Ben and Jerry’s. In explanation for their seemly strange acquisition, co-founder Ben Cohen found a variety of ways to work the phrases “horizontal integration” and “synergy” into a sentence.

In order to keep costs low, the quality control departments of PornHub & Jerry’s were merged. Many employees, unwilling to subject themselves to the “vile, unsavory nature” of ice cream manufacture, quit. As such, PornHub & Jerry’s began offering internships for college millennials, “The laziest generation, who are also coincidentally willing to work long hours for no pay.”

Little has changed in the public facing sides of PornHub & Jerry’s, with some minor exceptions. “Some of it is subtle, like Chubby Hubby has the same name and everything, just a different sort of vibe to it. And sometimes, when the shredded masseuse arrives to oil her up, the lady will be eating out of a branded pint container. Sometimes it’s more specific, like the gay porn where the one guy puts his dick in some rocky road.”
