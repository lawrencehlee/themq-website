Local Economics minor Jeremiah Parker gave an extensive talk about coming to terms with the harsh reality while waiting in line at a Starbucks last Thursday, describing our current situation as “unavoidable.”

“I mean, it’s about human nature,” Parker said. “Mankind will always find a way to manipulate the system for their benefit, and if that means that a billionaire can buy their way up a transplant list like it’s levels on Candy Crush, then that’s just the nature of the free market.”

When the Parker family’s affluence was brought into the discussion, Parker was quick to rebut. “Really, I think it’s ‘minorities’ who have the real advantage. Did you know that they get extra points when applying for jobs at the DMV? Meanwhile, when I graduate, I’m going to have to work hard at whatever entry level job my parents can get me. That’s real hard work.”

A response is planned by self-described Marxist Marcus Pointe, who would explain how the USSR wasn’t a real execution of communism if they were willing to acknowledge that part of history happened at all.
