Earlier this month president Obama officially restored the name of the United States’ highest mountain from Mount McKinley to the original Mount Denali. In staunch political opposition to the move, American car manufacturer GMC stated in a public comment that they would be changing the name of their star truck from Denali to “GMC McKinley”.

“This president has spit in the face of everyday Americans too often. One of our founding fathers, 25th President McKinley didn’t beat back those taco-eaters in Manila Bay 1898 so that a great landscape can be given away to some Little Voting Capital Big Ego chief,” GMC executive Dan Ammann stated.

The mountain, which was originally named Mount Denali, has been listed on all official and federal documents as “Mount McKinley” since 1980.

“I don’t have a problem with Native Americans,” Ammann continued, “but it’s very indicative of this socialist freedom-hater to change his mind on critical issues. You know what he is? He’s an Indian Giver!”

GMC officials did not back down or apologize for their offensive comments, but instead doubled down on them. At press time, GMC announced that anyone applying to finance a GMC car must provide proof of proficiency and fluency in “The Queen’s English.”
