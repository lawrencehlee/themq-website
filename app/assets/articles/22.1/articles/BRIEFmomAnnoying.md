At move-in day for Muir College last Saturday, incoming freshman Randy Culvers official commenced his college experience and, accompanied by his family, thousands of other students, and their families, took a major step toward the independent college experience.

“It could have been a pleasant memory,” remarked Culvers. “It was something I had looked forward to for a while, but, as usual, my mom had to make it awkward.”

Culvers stated that his mom tallied 15 instances of unprompted crying, eight forced introductions with other freshman, and 32 “questions that we all knew the answers to, but that she wanted to ask just to make an impression on the administration.”

"I briefly mentioned this one girl, Ashley, who I thought was kind of cute. Well, before I knew it, my nosey mom barged down the hall and invited Ashley and her whole family to an early dinner at Denny’s.

“I should have never invited mom to come,” Culvers mumbled. “She’s killing my vibe. She argued with me about what comforter to buy at Bed Bath and Beyond for two hours before she decided Target's selection was better.”

At press time, Culvers and his mother were crying uncontrollably as the car arrived to take his family to the airport.
