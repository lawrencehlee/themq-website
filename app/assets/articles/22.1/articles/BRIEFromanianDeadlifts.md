Strife rocked the small town of Nadlac earlier this month when renowned amateur lifter Janos Koszegi died while performing Romanian deadlifts in Nadlac’s premier gym, Gabor’s Haus of Work Muscles. Situated on the border of western Romania and Hungary, Nadlac has become a target of the international spotlight by reigniting the feud between the two countries.

Coverage of the incident varies wildly across the border. According to a Hungarian newspaper, “Koszegi was a beloved man, and while it is unfortunate that this accident occurred, the fact that he was killed by Romanian deadlifts was hardly surprising, as Romanians are known to be difficult to work with.”

A Romanian newspaper rebutted that "the injuries [Koszegi] sustained were more likely due to his dumb hairy hands being too greasy to hold the bar.”

Tensions continued to rise as both countries launched increasingly aggressive slander at the other, with Romania accusing Hungary of being a “sore loser,” and Hungary countering that Romania was still upset about briefly losing Transylvania. Transylvania responded, “nations rise and fall, and the petty squabbles of mortal men continue to produce rivers of salty blood. So we have seen and so it shall be until the end days.”
