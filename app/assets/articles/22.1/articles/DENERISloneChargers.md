Hollywood resident Allison Davis told reporters at a press conference in Los Angeles today that not only does she firmly believe that the NFL’s San Diego Chargers will move to the city next season, but that she “will become the team’s number one brochacha,” as she put it, when they do.

The press conference, arranged by NFL consultant Carmen Policy, comes as the Chargers continue to work on their plan to share a stadium in Carson, California, with the Oakland Raiders. The plan, says Policy, is “a backup option the teams have been forced to contemplate due to their current cities’ refusal to hand them billions of tax-exempt dollars for stadiums that they will use eight times a year.”

In a related development, multiple sources, including the U.S. Census, confirmed that according to their extensive research, Davis holds the distinction of being the only supporter of the Chargers in the entirety of Los Angeles County.

“We checked Santa Monica, Long Beach, and even Valencia,” said NFL marketing intern Rodney Korpics. “Ms. Davis was the only person we could find who said they were a Chargers fan.”

Korpics went on to state that common responses to questions about the potential move among LA County residents included, “RAIDER NATION,” “Wait, San Diego has a football team?” and, “Look, are you going to take a copy of my screenplay or not?”

Policy, who has been an ardent supporter of the teams’ ambitions to move to Los Angeles, explained at the press conference that the teams’ bitter rivalry and disparity in Angeleno fans will be easy for the Chargers to overcome.

“We know that Los Angeleshad the Raiders for 10 years, including one that ended with a Super Bowl, and that Raiders fans have hated the Chargers since 1960,” he said. “But what you have to remember is that the Chargers will switch conferences when they move in with the Raiders down here. Once that happens, the two will only play once every four years, and we’re very confident that Angelenos will have no trouble rooting for the Raiders and the Chargers.

“After all, the Raiders and 49ers are just miles apart right now, but I’d hardly say those two have a rivalry,” he added.

When asked to comment on the team’s popularity in Los Angeles, Chargers owner Dean Spanos replied, “Look, LA is just a backup plan for us. As long we get a stadium plan that works for us, the Los Angeles Chargers are committed to the fine city of San Diego.

“Wait, I meant San Diego Chargers! Shit,” he continued.

Davis, meanwhile, told reporters that she is confident that her city will welcome her favorite team with open arms.

“I plan on attending every game,” said Davis, before being asked about her impressions of the team’s proposed stadium.

“Wait, they’re building the stadium in Carson?” she continued. “Never mind. I’m not sitting on the 110 for four hours every Sunday just to watch my team choke at the end of the season and miss the playoffs again. Forget it.”
