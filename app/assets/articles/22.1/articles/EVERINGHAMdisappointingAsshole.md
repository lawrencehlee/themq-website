A recent study coming out of one of UCSD's premier research labs has revealed, to the dismay of the research group, that one of their former colleagues is doing okay for himself.

“At UCSD we strive to find the answers to profound questions across many disciplines, and this study follows in that tradition,” said Dr. Woodbury, head of the laboratory which undertook the work. “The pertinent question here was one that really connected with everyone in our lab, namely: 'what ever happened to that snarky guy who worked here last year? I sure hope he crashed and burned.'”

The subject of the study, Brett Levitt, was a research assistant for Dr. Woodbury's lab before he left to pursue new opportunities last September. Levitt was known well to most of the lab members, and many cited his “dickishness” and his “just-begging-to-be-slapped-to-shit smirk” as the main force behind the project.

“One time he held up a group meeting for 45 minutes debating the pronunciation of the word 'coupon' while also hitting on my wife over the phone,” commented Dr. Woodbury, “So yeah, pretty much everyone wanted to check up on him and make sure he was reaping the shit from that one.”

The research was undertaken by an expert interdisciplinary team over the past six months, with funding from several large grants leveraged to utilize advanced, new surveillance technology and robust predictive behavioral models. Initial predictions based on karma and office betting pools anticipated that Levitt would be found “rotting in a gutter somewhere with not a penny to his name and no one to love him.”

But in what was described in the study's conclusion as “a moral upset to rival the aftermath of Kony 2012,” it happened that Levitt was actually enjoying a comfortable life in a prestigious career with an “obnoxiously attractive” wife. Data also indicated that despite Levitt’s continued insistence on using 'pusillanimous' as an insult and quoting Wikipedia in casual conversation he currently makes more than any of his former coworkers.

Project scientists report that the implications of these results are staggering. “It seems that the quality of a person's character may have no bearing whatsoever on his future success,” one researcher posited, “an idea which is both deeply upsetting and forces us to reconsider the moral order of the universe.”

Under this newly proposed model, scientists say that someone could, for example, both steal coke from the work fridge and find five dollars on the ground on the same day, a scenario which Dr. Woodbury describes as “patently bullshit.”

Really, the study is just beginning, as it has only released its preliminary findings and will continue to probe Levitt's life into the coming year in order to confirm them. But already a number of the project scientists have been inspired to launch further inquiries and expand on this newborn field of Retributive Psychology. “Next we want to double check that everyone who is a decent human being ends up with a good life,” said Dr. Woodbury with a chuckle, “because if that's not true we've got a real problem on our hands!”

A final possible follow-up to the study is what the group calls a “corrective experiment,” which would likely be a cheap and simple task as the only listed project materials are a baseball bat and Levitt's shins.
