The unearthing of a software bug in the CAPE system revealed that recent Revelle graduate Abel Aaronson has been the winner of the CAPE raffle for four years in a row.

“It was pretty funny after I won the second quarter,” Aaronson said on his insurmountable winnings. “I’ve been lucky with this type of thing before, and it’s not like I’m complaining about getting $400 worth in textbooks and four 2008 iPod Nanos.”

“Although, now that I think about it, it would have been crazy if I really did have such an impressive stroke of luck,” he admitted.

CAPE director Sonny Gonzales expressed surprise at the reported bug and how Aaronson had been winning, a result that has been decried by student body as unfair to the others who also invest their time and efforts.

“To my knowledge, there's been no report of any such bug in our system whatsoever,” said Gonzales. “I’ve also been assured our programs are ‘mediocre, but probably functional,’ which is a pretty strong statement.

“There’s only two options: either the bug doesn’t exist or our developers are massively incompetent; to be honest, I’m not sure which is more likely,” he mused.

Gonzales went on to explain that if the bug existed, it would be in the randomization part of the code, causing the system to always choose the first PID on the list.

“If, however, the program is randomizing fine, that means the number of recorded responses is so low tha — Harry, could you pull our total numbers for the past four years?”

“Of course I’m pissed when I heard that one person has been winning the raffle for four years in a row,” responded Warren third-year Randall Dexter-Burton to the news. “Can you imagine how cheated all those masses and masses of people who fill out their CAPEs every single quarter feel? That they didn’t even have a chance to begin with? This makes me want to fill them out even less, and it’s not like I ever did to begin with.”

Echoing the students’ thoughts on the situation, the UCSD Bookstore also expressed outrage at the perceived mishandling of its gifts.

“It’s not every day that people gain the ability to carry around 1000 of their favorite songs in a sleek, modern audio player,” said Sheridan Pratt, a representative from the UCSD Bookstore. “We were even planning to upgrade the prize to a 2010 Zune, which can hold a whopping 250 songs more than the iPod.

“So you can understand our anger and disappointment at the CAPE system when we heard that our graciously donated prizes went to the same person for four years,” Pratt continued. “He could have bought all his books for an entire quarter with those gift cards!”

Despite his intense criticism of the CAPE system, Dexter-Burton believes there exists a fairly simple solution to the issue that only requires a policy change.

“If the system is bugged such that one lucky entrant keeps winning when they do their CAPEs,” he said, “then just start discouraging students to fill them out so that nobody does them at all. That way, Aaronson or whoever gets chosen won’t win for four years straight again, and nobody can complain about ever losing the raffle.

“It’s like killing two birds with one massive stone.”
