Area man Brandon Newton recently expressed feelings of stress and inadequacy at the challenge of being at the center of everyone else’s lives: from friends and family, to coworkers, to people on the street. Newton has described the task as “Herculean, like raising  bunch of baby snakes or whatever he did.”

“It’s just a lot to live up to, you know? I love my friends, but it can be so hard being totally on for them, and I’m just so afraid to slip up,” said Newton, whose friends reportedly care about him but in fact continue to live full and complete lives even when he’s gone. “I just don’t want to say the wrong thing or hurt anyone’s feelings.

“I saw Karen the other day, and she was just ... she was just weird. She just kind of stared off into the distance half the time like she couldn’t even hear me. I mean, did I say something? I wish she’d just come and say it if I messed up somehow,” said Brandon of Karen Gill, daughter of Kevin Gill and Jane Conway, the victims of last month’s Streetcar Named Desire Tragedy.

Newton also reportedly found it increasingly difficult to deal with having to be “the life of the party.” Further, Newton claims he “doesn’t want to disappoint everyone by not being there,” but he can’t always be “Mr. Funny Guy” after a long day of work, and sometimes he has to let everyone down by staying in.

Newton, described by his supervisor as “an insignificant cog in an unthinkably massive machine that wouldn’t so much as slow if he were fed through it bodily,” has voiced concerns of what may occur if his work performances slip.

“I mean, stress gets to me sometimes, but I have a high pace job and I’m worried about how it will affect others if I, like, miss work or something. I wish other people could understand how hard it is to be doing something so crucial to the project.

“And there’s also just a lot of pressure from my family, who I think feel like I don’t call them enough, and I think they worry about me a lot,” Newton said to a friend last week.

When asked about her brother, Rose Ann Newton replied, “I don’t have any brothe– Wait, you mean Brandon? What about him?”

“I believe Brandon is suffering from what I call ‘Narcissistic Masochism,’” said psychologist Brenda Jones. It’s not currently officially recognized in Clinical Psychology, but the APA is planning on including it in the DSM-VI.

“Honestly, it’s less of a disorder and more of a personality trait associated with anxiety that we made up a diagnosis for in order to make a few more dollars and get some acclaim. Wait, are you writing down that last part too?”

“I really don’t know why he feels like he’s the center of everyone’s lives, you know?” said Newton’s best friend, Arthur Chelsea. “When that’s so clearly Erica.”

“Erica’s my rock,” said Gill, in response to questions about her parents’ grisly deaths at the hands of the actress who played Blanche in the local adaptation of Streetcar.

“Oh, Erica,” said Newton’s sister.

“Erica ... I mean, wow,” said Jones.
