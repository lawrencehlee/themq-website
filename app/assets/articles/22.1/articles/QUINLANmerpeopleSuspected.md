The U.S. Coast Guard entered aquamarine alert last Wednesday when local lifeguard Mikey Brookes discovered a decapitated sea lioness along the shores of Black’s Beach. After performing rigorous tests, such as poking it with a shovel, police pronounced it deceased.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) believes the culprits to be members of the Four Tribes of Merlin-a Merpeople confederation that resides eight miles into sea from where the headless creature was found.

When asked about the incident, 23-year-old Brookes, the newest addition to the No One Drowns When We’re Around Lifeguard Squad (NODWWALS), responded: “You’d be way surprised of what the average lifeguard sees these days, brah. I thought I’d meet rad chicks, get a killer tan...just like David Hasselhoff! D-u-u-u-d-e, I never thought it’d get this gnarly.”

These “gnarly” waters turned volatile when, upon hearing about Merpeoples’ expected involvement in the decapitation, the European League of Mermen and Merwomen (ELMM) — an international Merpeople rights organization — accused the NOAA of leading a “biased investigation intended to curtail the already dwindling rights of Merpeople.”

According to the ELMM, Merpeople’s rights have been restricted worldwide since the 1700s, when notoriously ostentatious Captain Shufflebottom discovered the first Merperson on a fishing expedition. Upon the discovery, Shufflebottom wrote, “Hark! What primitive, abnormal beasts I chanced upon. I, Antoine Philippe Honeysuckle Shufflebottom, have yielded new possibilities the world has never known! Until now...”

Today, basic human rights — including the right to wear shoes, use portable water canisters, own a scarletchested parakeet, and eat fish in public—are not extended to Merpeople.

According to ELMM spokes-Merperson Ima Fisch, “Merpeople continually fight for their rights and face undue criminal profiling from institutions like the NOAA. We aren’t responsible for the sea lioness’s death. These wild accusations reinforce interspecies prejudices.

“For generations, humans have driven MerTribes from their waters and tarnished our reputations with fictitious fairy tales! That’s why we work every moon-hour to restore to Merpeople what’s rightfully theirs!”

The NOAA released a statement last Friday saying a “highly-trained team” of undergraduate forensic analysts found “shark teeth” lodged into the creature’s “tissue.”

“This further validates our suspicion of Four Tribes of Merlin, who commonly use shark teeth for weapons and weddings,” says NOAA spokesperson Uno Eyeesadik.

A survey conducted on Twitter revealed that since the investigation escalated, public sympathies toward Merpeople have declined by 27 percent, reaching a total of only 7 percent voting for the sympathetic “frowny face” emoji.

This investigation may also threaten the upcoming reelection campaign of Massachusetts Senator Mortimer Manatee, who, after his naturalization in 2002, became the first Merperson Senator in 2014. Manatee claims that humans have become increasingly “specist” towards him, going to such lengths as mailing dead fish to his office.

Yesterday, Manatee instagrammed, “I won’t condone violence. These aggressive acts toward myself and other innocent Merpeople won’t be tolerated. My hope is whoever has bitten off the head of this beautiful sea lioness is brought to justice.”

But for Rick Oliver, an Aquatic Life Specialist with a B.S. from IEnteredMyNameAndPrintedOutMyDegree.com University, there are bigger issues than political campaigns and inter-organizational warfare.

“Four Tribes of Merlin are traditionally peaceful. Their involvement is highly unlikely,” Oliver states. “We believe what happened at Black’s Beach was a megalodon attack.”

Oliver’s research into megalodons — an ancient breed of shark that once swam our oceans millions of years ago — found they are not extinct, but rather “they’re thriving!” Oliver continued. “If we turn our backs on the possibility this monster is out there, we will see more decapitations! And next me, it could be you!”
