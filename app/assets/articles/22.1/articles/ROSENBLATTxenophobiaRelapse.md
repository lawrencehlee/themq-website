Alabama Resident Carrie Brunswick, 73, reportedly suffered from a severe xenophobia attack last Friday evening after returning to her home from a 32 year-long stay in recovery programs aimed at preventing such attacks. Brunswick's family members became concerned after Brunswick began rushing around the house attempting to barricade all of the doors and windows while humming the theme song from “Leave It to Beaver.”

Brunswick developed chronic xenophobia in the mid-sixties, when she began to fear that her Russian neighbors were “just waiting to burst into my house with the dirty hammers they always carried and chop up my well-groomed rose bushes with those sickles I know they were hiding in their communal garage.”

Doctors, upon first examining Brunswick’s case in 1967, were unable to cite the origin of these irrational fears, and assigned her to a recovery program at Liberty Oasis Psychiatric Center in Birmingham, Alabama. Brunswick reportedly appeared to make a speedy recovery after being isolated in Liberty Oasis for a little over a week. However, she suffered from relapses on multiple occasions during attempted releases, exhibiting behaviors ranging from wearing an American flag as a cape to, more recently, trying to burn down a local Mexican Restaurant.

After regaining her composure at Liberty Oasis, Brunswick described the most recent incident.

“I was just sitting at home and flipping through news channels when I started to get an uneasy feeling. There's just so many ethnic people nowadays, it gives me the chills. One moment, I was watching a report on the current state of Iran. But the next, I saw those ISIS people drilling through the wall from East Germany right into my backyard so that they could launch their plot to get rid of all the hamburgers and hot dogs in America.

“I just knew at any second they would start making us wear black robes as they slowly morphed into giant, red, commie octopuses trying to reach their sticky, rapidly industrializing tentacles all over my blue morning glories.”

When asked if she knew of anything that could make her more at ease, Brunswick responded: “I just wish Obama would hurry up and build that giant wall everyone on the news is talking about before Stalin helps the Mexicans invade us and rip out all of the job-listing pages from our newspapers.”

The possibility of finding a more permanent cure for Brunswick’s condition has been puzzling psychologists and doctors alike since she was diagnosed. However, her main psychologist, Matt Sharif, is investigating several likely therapies that could calm her and prevent her attacks from escalating, including massaging her ear lobes and listening to punk rock.

Brunswick is currently undergoing further psychological testing, and Liberty Oasis is seeking new psychologists to look at her case; however, Sharif reported it has been difficult to find someone new that Brunswick is comfortable with. He explained, “we have recruited the top psychologists from all corners of the globe, including China, Mexico, Somalia, and Iraq, only to have them driven off by Mrs. Brunswick screaming about ‘global trade balance’ and ‘Sharia law.’”

Sharif at Liberty Oasis is currently planning to try and more slowly ease Brunswick into a normal, newswatching lifestyle, and has equipped her room with cable TV, which she is encouraged to watch regularly to stay up to date. However, as an added precaution, news segments are accompanied by gentle ear rubbing and punk music, in an attempt to follow the classical conditioning methods Liberty Oasis staff learned reading “A Clockwork Orange.”
