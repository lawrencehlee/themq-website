Last week, area resident Aleesha Banks reached total self-actualization and inner peace after months of hard work and reflection, “really disappointing” those close to her.

The ensuing wave of resentment amongst her once-supportive social network has since reached critical levels, fragmenting the order of the local community. The PTA at Chilblains Elementary where Banks’ child attends, once a productive and agreeable organization, reported increased personal and professional difficulties in preparing for upcoming events.

“[Banks] hasn’t been pulling her weight at all with the Fall Carnival, which we all voted should be assigned to her months ago,” explained Chilblains Elementary parent Jennifer Collins. When reminded Banks had refused the nomination, citing other commitments, Collins explained “Well, yeah, she said that, but we ignored it. I mean, she usually does whatever task we give her. It’s just what happens.”

Collins added, "I respect her decision and we’ve been encouraging her to be more independent, at least in regards to the soccer team, but this is taking it too far." Collins went on to say “the kicker” was the other day when Banks “wouldn’t even get defensive” after accused of being aggressively irresponsible and hating all the schoolchildren.

Banks’ child’s teacher, Mr. Carlson, shared some frustrations with the PTA, noting that he’s since had to broaden his appeal to other parents for classroom help. He stressed that while he “of course” understood Bank’s decision to go down from four days to two, it was “just really inconsiderate” of Banks.

“I don’t want to use the word selfish, but I just have a lot going on right now, and she knows the California Missions unit is coming up,” Carlson sighed, shaking his head as he fed students’ completed science worksheets through a shredder.

Banks’ never-ending happiness and self-assuredness has caused small altercations throughout the city as community members are “subjected to the harassment” of chance encounters with her.

“It’s not okay,” said area resident Shaun Johnson. “I was standing in front of her in line at Wal-Mart waiting to buy my generic “Wally Martin” cheese puffs and a spare bike tire, and the cashier was taking a little while longer than I wanted. I huffed and turned around to ask if she could believe this, and she just said ‘I’m sure she’s doing the best she can.’ Unbelievable.”

“If she wants to treat a cashier with dignity and respect, then she can keep it to herself,” concluded Johnson.

Banks’ house was egged last night, likely by disgruntled citizens as a sign painted in ketchup reading “WE ALL HATE YOU, ALEESHA” would suggest. When reached for comment, Banks shared she was planning on hosting a neighborhood brunch, saying “Well, being in my clearest zen mind, I instantly saw an opportunity arise out of the broken eggs, and decided it would be a good idea to make some omelettes.”
