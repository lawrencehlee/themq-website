Hasbro, Inc.’s President and CEO Brian Goldner revealed a new version of the popular game Monopoly earlier this month, in remembrance of one year passing since the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. The game, “Monopoly: Socioeconomic Inequalities Edition” comes with a brand new set of properties and includes a few never-before-seen rule changes.

“We wanted to bring Monopoly into the fold of current events and discussions while still keeping the same beloved family atmosphere it’s so known for,” stated Goldner in a press release. “That’s why we’ve added such mechanics as ‘The Projects Lane.’ This is a small avenue of reasonably affordable, not at all dangerous, public properties that players may choose to venture into, or, if they are in good enough financial standing, take the detour around.”

Perhaps the greatest addition to “Monopoly: Dysfunctional Criminal Justice System Edition” can be found in the new way in which players can go to and get out of jail. Quoted directly from the rule book, “The jail is to be divided into two sections, one for the A token group – Top Hat, Automobile, Battleship, Bag of Money – and another for the B group – Iron, Shoe, Broken TV, Food Stamp. The A group, once in jail, may leave after one turn or by paying a 50$ fine. The B group, once in jail, must stay there for a minimum sentence of at least three turns, followed by a required bail of 200$ which must be posted one day prior to release.

“A player without sufficient funds may be bailed out by another player, or else must buy into a harsh cyclic system of minimum jail times and lifelong debts, creating another generation who will grow up like the one before it without fine, mentoring men and women in their lives, represented in the game by a small grey plastic chain.”

Critical reception to “Monopoly: Inner City School Budget Cuts Edition” has been mixed, with some reviewers claiming it portrays modern society in far too harsh a light.

“On one half of the board every third square is a “police stop”, and the other half of the board is gated! I can’t even land on Boardwalk without getting pulled over at least twice and having to show my papers,” exclaimed one such critic Thomas Jackson, the now retired former police chief of Ferguson. “This can’t be what society is really like.”

But other reviewers welcome “Monopoly: Do You Really Think Voting For Bernie Sanders is Going to Help? Edition.” “Nothing has ever symbolized our recent plight and hardships more succinctly and poignantly,” explains black activist Wiebe Tinga, “than adding the Slim Chance card pile to the board.”

CEO Goldner has indicated that this is just the beginning, and that more culturally attuned games are on the way. “As an industry leader, Hasbro must step boldly into the 21st century and become a staple in the increasingly socially-aware American family. If that means releasing “Top Income Bracket’s Hungry Hungry Capital Gain-os” or “No Ladders, Just Chutes” or “Sorry! Not Sorry Women!” then so be it.”

“Monopoly: I’ve Stopped Believing in the American Dream Edition” can be found at any local Target or Toys R’ Us. Look for it in the lavish maple colored wooden box, or the lead painted cardboard box if you live on the wrong side of the highway.
