As demonstrated in all 10 editions of high school and college Pearson general biology textbooks, scientific research has proven the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

As seen in Figure 3.2, the Mitochondria is clearly producing all the energy that powers the cell (denoted by small lightning bolts), and if you look to Figure 3.3 you will find a diagram of a power plant which also produces energy (denoted by slightly larger lightning bolts). The parallels are undeniable and verifies that the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

Pearson is a dignified and world-renowned publishing company. To imply that this institution would ever print something inaccurate is almost as ridiculous as suggesting that the Mitochondria is not the powerhouse of the cell.

If you are still having trouble grasping these concepts, consider investing an extra 100 dollars in the Extended Edition of “Campbell’s Biology Concepts and Connections,” featuring a diagram with a more sophisticated power plant and more realistic lightning bolts. These improvements illustrate even more precisely that the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
