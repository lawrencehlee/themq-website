//This here file is to manually enter which ed_pcps will appear on the ed_pcp index page
//Putting ed_pcp_ids here, which will be used to find the active record
//must be careful to only put ids of points, not counterpoints, although there should be logic to pretect against that
//_op story must be an editorial
//if in the '_ore stories' section there is a counterpoint, make sure to place it right after the point
//	but not straddling positions 3 and 4, so that the pcp won't be split over 2 lines in the lg
//	screen size or the md screen size
