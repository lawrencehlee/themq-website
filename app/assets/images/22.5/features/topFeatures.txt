//This here file is to manually enter which features will appear on the feature index page
//Putting feature_ids here, which will be used to find the active record
//Splitting this into three, the first section is for the main story, which will be the centerspread from that issue.
//The second will be two _olumn features (word misspelled to avoid codefusion), they will be next to each other
//The third will be one or two horizontal features. Wouldn't recommend putting more than 2 things there. A BP would be nice for extra color
