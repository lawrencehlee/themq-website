Founded in 1989ish, we strive to offer a critical (read: self-aware, responsibly-grown) perspective on real (read: sorta real) stories that matter to (read: show up on the Facebook feeds of) and affect (read: gently caress) the lives of our readers (read: “humans”).</p>
        <p class="actual-paragraph">You can find us every Tuesday at 6 p.m. in Muir College’s <a class="author-link" href="http://bit.ly/nyfgWP">Half Dome Lounge</a>.</p>
        <p class="actual-paragraph">There’s always something to do, from writing, editing, and copying to Photoshopping, InDesigning, illustrating, or publicizing. Absolutely no experience required, only the ability to find us. I'll be wearing a red feather in my hat.</p>
