# This here file is to manually enter which articles will appear on the article index page
# We'll see if this is the way to go
# I'm going to try to make it as least based on line numbers and stuff like that
# Putting article_ids here, which will be used to find the active record

# This page contains data for determining exactly which articles, eds, features will be put on the home page
# There are 4 sections here, slideshow, news, more, and features
# The ids are picked up by the line before them, so don't change the sections titles, or else
main:
  # first is the slideshow. Put articles ids and those articles will appear in the slideshow on front page.
  # My suggestion would be articles with strong headlines or really instantly funny graphics.
  # Five is plenty for this I wouldn't go over that, but also not under 3

  # this next section should only contain ids for editorials or points, NOT counterpoints
  # also no more than 2 things, that is 2 eds or 1 ed 1 point, don't do 2 points
  # last thing, if you want a point, put it AFTER the ed

# This here file is to manually enter which features will appear on the feature index page
# Putting feature_ids here, which will be used to find the active record
# Splitting this into three, the first section is for the main story, which will be the centerspread from that issue.
# The second will be two column features (word misspelled to avoid codefusion), they will be next to each other
# The third will be one or two horizontal features. Wouldn't recommend putting more than 2 things there. A BP would be nice for extra color
