Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed last week that the company is working on rolling out a “Dislike” button to its wildly popular social media platform, a move that he said would “revolutionize cyberbullying.”

“It used to be that when someone said something you didn’t like, you had to leave a nasty comment or threatening private message to express what a miserable twerp they were,” Zuckerberg said. “But now, making someone on the Internet feel like absolute shit just for telling you about their day has never been easier.”\

Facebook programmer Brianna Damon told reporters that her team has made an effort to make the new button as versatile as possible.

“Our research showed that there are all kinds of situations where the dislike button can come into play,” she said. “We were initially working on the political angle, but we realized that everyone from 13-year-old bullies to vindictive ex-boyfriends would be able to benefit from this new feature.”

Facebook is reportedly working on a suite of additional button options, including a “Meh” button, a “This Article is so Fake” button, and a “For The Last Time Grandma, Obama Was Born in Hawaii, Not Kenya” button.
