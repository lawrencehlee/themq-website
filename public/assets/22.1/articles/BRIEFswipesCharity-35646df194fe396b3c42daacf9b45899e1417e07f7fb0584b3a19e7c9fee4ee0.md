Henry Steward, a freshman in Warren College, has paid for the shipping of his ID card to the country of Sudan for charity.

Steward cited a variety of reasons for the act of charity, saying, “I feel like the poor people of Sudan could use these dining dollars more than me. My parents bought me a microwave and mini fridge for my temp-triple so I see these dollars going to much better use by the Sudanese people.”

“With these dining dollars, one Sudanese person who travels to San Diego can eat for three quarters!”

This act has received considerable attention from UCSD officials, who commented that “this act is preposterous. Steward will need a new ID card to get into his dorm room. However we also welcome the Sudanese people to use our facilities with the dining dollars if they choose to visit campus. We think they will love our fully vegetarian and vegan restaurant, Roots!” Other students have followed Steward, sending their IDs to “Pines Pizza for Palestine.”
