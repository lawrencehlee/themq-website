Planetary scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced the results of an intensive study of Kepler-452b, an exoplanet, which despite her completely different size, appearance, location, age, and music tastes is widely known as “Earth’s twin.”

The study, conducted by lead planetary behavior expert Johanna Kipling, concluded that, despite the two planets’ shared upbringing, Earth is better than her wayward sister “in almost every way imaginable.”

“Our findings are conclusive,” said Kipling. “Although the two planets are indeed twin siblings, every observation we’ve made supports the conclusion that Kepler-452b is completely inadequate in every way compared to Earth, from the amount of friends they have to their SAT scores.

“Kepler-452b is the prodigal planet, if you will,” she added.

While the discovery of this long-lost relative of Earth has sent shockwaves throughout the human community, the reaction of her relatives in the Solar System has been markedly less enthusiastic.

“Don’t you dare speak that child’s name in this System,” said our Sun when asked about her estranged daughter.

“You don’t think I gave her that stupid name, do you? No, she’ll always be Theia to me. But she went and changed it to some other name with a bunch of numbers after it. Claimed it was more ‘unique.’ That was right before she—she ...” the Sun continued, before violently destroying a passing comet with a solar flare.

“We were really close for a while. She even got me my first pet,” said Earth, gesturing toward the Moon as he orbited nearby. “Who’s a good satellite? Who’s tidally locked to his mommy? You are! Yes you are! “Anyway, things really started to change when she started smoking comets,” Earth continued. “Mom even tried to get Jupiter to throw them into the Oort Cloud, but it was no use. Enough got through and she slipped deeper into addiction.

“Then one day, she got into a huge fight with our brother Mars. She was making fun of him for how tiny his moons are, and the next thing I knew they started going at it.

“After that, she just packed her bags and left. Shot off toward another star system and we never heard from her again. I mean, she could at least send a Winter Solstice card or something.” Kepler-452b’s own account of her departure from the Solar System, however, is markedly different than that of her fellow planets.

“What you have to understand is that my goodie twoshoes sister Earth was always the favorite,” she said, her frustration causing a slight liberation in her orbit.

“And it wasn’t just with Mom. Everyone liked her better. She even got asked on a date by Saturn! And let me tell you, ‘Jewel of the Solar System’ is an understatement as far as he’s concerned,” she continued, a slight blush showing in her southern ocean.

“Meanwhile the only one interested in me was Uranus,” she said with a slight shudder. “I mean, it’s bad enough that he named all his moons after Shakespeare characters, but how am I even supposed to make eye contact with him, let alone do anything else, when he’s tilted 96 goddamn degrees from his orbit?”

At press time, Kipling’s team had uncovered what they thought to be evidence of a steamy love affair between Kepler-452b and a second, unknown planet, only to realize that it was, in fact, a smudge on their telescope.
