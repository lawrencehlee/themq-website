Last Thursday, during a meet-and-greet pizza party for Intervarsity Ministry, freshman Matthew Gracieux revealed to a group of acquaintances that he is “ecstatic” to finally be able to vote and participate in the upcoming election. He re- inforced that he has waited his entire life to perform this civic duty, and feels “more American than ever” with this new responsibility.

“I don’t know about you guys, but this is something I have been dreaming about for at least my entire childhood,” said Gracieux to his friends, adjusting his name tag, which had bent in the crease of his shirt so as to make his name illegible. “First we had Bush, then Obama, and now, we get to decide who the next leader of this fine country will be. Our influential votes could potentially sway the course of this nation. Anyone want more pepperoni?”

The group was interrupted mid-discourse for the spaghetti-marshmallow engineering competition, and subsequently to hear the message for that night’s introductory meeting. However, Gracieux’s dialogue continued after the meeting, when he approached a new congregation of potential listeners, this time with the intention of “discussing the issues.”

“Have you guys seen the recent news on our borders? Completely surreal. Finally, someone is smart enough to actually put in a door so that people can get in,” railed Gracieux. When asked about his sources, Gracieux remarked, “It’s everywhere! But I can share the EMGN link with you on Facebook.

“We have Trump, then there’s Ben Carson. And then, of course, there’s Hillary ... don’t even get me STARTED on Hillary. It’s a miracle she is even this far in, considering she has literally run for the presidency, like, 70 times. Right? Unreal.”

Cheryl Adams, a freshman who took AP Political Science in 2014, said that Gracieux seemed to know very little about what the candidates thought, saying, “He just kind of threw out names ofthe candidates. At one point, I asked him what he thought of Carly Fiorina’s stance on abortion, and he just responded with a stare and said that he was surprised that a chef from Food Network was running for president.

“My best guess is that he thought I was talking about Giada de Laurentis, but who knows?” Adam finished. “They both sound Italian, I guess.”

When asked who he would most want to see in office, Gracieux prefaced by saying that he would need to read up more on each candidate, but that, “as things sit right now, and from what I’ve seen in the news, I want that one Republican — the one that the official group of Republicans thingy already chose to be the President — and who we get to vote for! I’m just really excited! I’m changing the world.

“Wait, when do we get to vote for Vice President, again? That comes after we vote for the President, I think,” Gracieux said. “I can’t wait to get the sticker, too!”

Unfortunately, Gracieux left shortly afterward to participate in a “pivotal” meeting to end childhood hunger in Malaysia. However, Adams had more to say regarding Gracieux and his excitement.

“Matt said his next steps were to talk to his parents about what they think and ‘hopefully get into a heated political argument, fingers crossed.’ Then, he wants to register to vote, although he thinks you do that by mailing your driver’s license to the White House. I wasn’t about to correct him, though.”

Gracieux’s dedication to civic duty should become more prevalent among the American population in the coming months, especially with coming debates. The next one is scheduled for October and will be televised on all major news networks.
