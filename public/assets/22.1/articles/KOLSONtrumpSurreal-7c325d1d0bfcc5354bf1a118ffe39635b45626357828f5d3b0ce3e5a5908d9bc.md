America continued to struggle to understand the events of Donald Trump’s speech last Thursday. The speech, another in a series of campaign speeches dedicated to the issues Trump feels most strongly about, took a surprising turn when Trump first deviated from his proposed subject of immigration.

Beginning by thanking the audience for this “Trumportunity” Trump moved to his vision of America, accompanied by a PowerPoint largely featuring images of himself.

“You know, when I first invented this great country, I had imagined it to be a melting pot, full of dirty immigrants. And my dreams have been largely fulfilled, as they are my dreams, and everything I do is right.”

The audience began to cheer. Trump continued on, seemingly indifferent, though his hair grew taller and hardened into solid gold.

“There are 73 million minors in the United States. That’s 100 million potential workers! Sure, there are child labor laws, but hey, I’m the President. Who else but the Vietnamese fit into tiny spaces like engines and furnaces like that? I promised you job creation—” Trump paused, and then, his voice deepening, he growled “...and I keep my promises.”

Dozens of miniature fireworks erupted throughout the auditorium, resolving into sparkling “promises” that hung in the air. Several people fainted out of “pure, pure, joy,” dragging those standing near them to the ground. As cries for help began to spread from those watching outside the venue, witnesses say Trump screamed “LET THEM BE, THEY’RE SLEEPING” and attempted to push away the entering medics with “the force of [his] mind.”

Audience members quickly forced the medics out in a wave that trampled several overtaken by Trump-inspired ecstasy. Witnesses reported that “where each attendee fell, two more took their place.” The multiplying pack quickly spilled onto the street and dragged an 18-wheeler truck into the auditorium where it was immediately flipped.

Small fires broke out while Trump continued to rail upon the state of the US, all the while growing larger and more imposing.

“The United States is going downhill! It’s like this podium,” Trump cried, gesturing at his lectern. “Soon we will be nothing more than a pile of splinters and ash!” And with the slightest touch of his finger, the podium exploded into a shower of wood, sprinkling audience members in what he called “The Trump Zone.”

Even without a mic system Trump’s voice rang out over the deafening sound of the audience.

“Gun control is a simple matter of destiny. We’ve controlled our own guns since we’ve been shooting Indians with them, and I see no reason to stop now. In fact, we need more guns. If you only have one gun, what’s to stop a guy with two guns from taking your one gun?”

Trump then reached into his hair, noting that he himself had “several guns,” and pulled out two fistfuls of sparkling rifles, eliciting cheers from the audience.

Witnesses reported that Trump flung his arms out wide, eyes rolling back in his head, and let out a guttural roar. A crack of thunder struck and with a flash of light, every audience member was holding a gun.

Unseeing and terrible, Trump spoke his final words: “If you want speeches like this every day and a wall around Mexico, vote for me. I can’t make this a reality without your help, now get into my mouth.” Trump then opened his mouth impossibly wide and the throng of spectators rushed to form a line.

Despite eating a surprising percentage of the state’s voters, Trump still seems to be leading the polls.
