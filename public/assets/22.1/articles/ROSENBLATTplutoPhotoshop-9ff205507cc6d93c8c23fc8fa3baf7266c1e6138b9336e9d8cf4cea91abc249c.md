Rearchers at NASA released “new and improved” images of Pluto earlier this week after a disappointing public response towards New Horizons’ photos from early July. Researchers utilized cutting-edge photo editing technology to make visuals that, according to Dr. Elena Schmidt, “made astronomical discovery accessible and so much more entertaining than your average reddit article.”

Initially, the photos of Pluto taken by New Horizons were met by a combination of apathy and skepticism. Many seemed unaware of the probe's journey or purpose. One skeptic, Alex Balandin, explained his doubts about the photos in several blog posts such as:

“Those scientists need to get their stories straight if they want us to really believe something like this. They keep ranting about all of that space junk that’s flying around everywhere, but then they show us these perfectly clear pictures with NO space junk in them. Do they expect us to believe that the probe they used was also equipped with a laser that can just disintegrate all the space junk around Pluto too, or what?”

Balandin furthered he was disappointed that NASA believed the American public “lacked a basic understanding of photography and astrology,” and explained, “also the shadows of the rocks in the top-right region should have been longer, since there was so much less gravity acting on them there.”

Scientists, in order to combat this negative feedback, launched a new program called MAFKOA, or “Make Astronomy Fun and Kind Of Accurate,” devoted to making the New Horizons images seem more exciting and believable.

NASA official Connor Johansen stated, “The few dedicated graduate students assigned to this project underwent intensive Photoshop training before embarking on their mission that would forever change humankind's understanding of the universe, and enable them to put pictures of their friends' heads on cute animal bodies.”

The new Pluto images include larger mountains and geographic features, giant purple dinosaurs wearing various articles of clothing, and more. One graduate student assigned to the mission explained, “In order to make the images more appealing, we accentuated a lot of Pluto's features, and then added some of our own, like a big lava pit right next to its north pole. We also blurred out some segments of the planet to keep up an air of mystery about space.”

Graduate student Cheyenne Burns, the woman responsible for the clothed dinosaur addition, also shared her experience and inspirations.

“I wanted to include some form of life on the planet to spur more excitement about Pluto's exploration,” Burns explained. “I decided on dinosaurs because they were foreign enough to intrigue people, but not enough to scare people. The clothing was meant to show that the creatures were really just like us, and they added a hint of color and style to the composition of the graphic.”

Upon first release, the images seem to be effective at satisfying skeptics. As avid Balandin supporter Edmond Grey describes, “The new images from the probe are much more convincing, and too bizarre to be fake. Also, who would purposely blur out parts of an image?”

The scientific community hailed the images as a giant leap towards a public more informed and supportive of the astronomical community. As revealed by a NASA reader’s poll, five percent of the respondents hailed the pictures as “Revolutionary,” two percent called them “Good enough to make a pretty solid meme,” and 93 percent voted “If Pluto’s not technically a planet, why do we still care about it?”
