SD student Michael Walters arrived at the conclusion today that while he had hoped the academic and social dissatisfaction he faced his first year would fade away, his second year was shaping up to be just as mediocre. Walters stated while he knew freshman year would be somewhat of "an adjustment," he never anticipated sophomore year to be “just as shitty.”

“I knew the moment I set foot on campus as a UCSD freshman, I was going to get my ass kicked, both academically and [physically] by upperclassmen," Walters said. "But to have the same experience as a sophomore? Evil SunGod must have it out for me.”

Walters had returned to campus last week with high expectations for his second year and intending to make progress on his naively quick-paced four-year plan. However, his graduation date was extended indefinitely after being reminded by an academic counselor that “Studies of Social Angst” was not a real major, nor was his planned minor in Video Game Ethnographies.

“I can’t tell if I’m just making poor decisions, or the educational system is completely dysfunctional. It’s probably the educational system,” said Walters, shaking his head.

Although Walters appeared to be bewildered by this “disappointing” first half of his collegiate endeavors, testimonials from his friends and family contributed more information.

“To be honest, Mike is just incompetent,” said Tyree Jones, Walters’ roommate. “He never attends lecture and is always sleeping in. In fact, I don’t actually think he registered for classes last quarter. Explains why he got lost so much.”

Nadia Salen, Walters’ cousin who also attends UCSD, noted that Walters had expressed disgust at the challenging statistics and programming courses required for an alternative major in Sociology or ICAM. She further observed Walters spent a lot of his time “moping around in Pines with a Gameboy covered in stickers about anarchy or something” last year.

When asked for comment, Walters dismissed these claims as “outlandish.”

“Whether or not I went to class or am even enrolled as a UCSD student is irrelevant. My lackluster experiences are clearly due to factors out of my control and I am in no way responsible for my own happiness,” explained Walters.

Though still planning on continuing what some dubiously refer to as his “education”, Walters made an effort to note his great displeasure about the upcoming year, particularly about his USP 1 class.

“It would be immature of me to assume I could be at fault for my own continuing student status or decisions. After all, nihilism is the only truth. I honestly think I’m going to be a good role model for the incoming freshmen.”
