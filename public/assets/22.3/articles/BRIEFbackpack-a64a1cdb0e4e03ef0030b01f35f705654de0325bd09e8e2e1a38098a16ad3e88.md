Recent feedback on the rucksack sex act reveals the sad sack fallback is a draw-back.

Once popular in the time of smokestacks and railroad tracks, the act recently made a surprising comeback after Jack Black broke his back. After seeing a quack, Black began wearing the pack in the sac to realign his back and saw it counteract his hurting back. He began to tout the act to his claque by releasing a tract called “The Jack Backpack Aphrodisiac Throwback.” Once the almanac got rave feedback, he began to transact packs called “Jack Black’s Comeback RuckSack” in the colors of lilac, cognac and soot black.

But all was not right for Black’s compact paperback. As people yakked about the act’s lack of tact, it was smacked for being an artifact like sex in kayaks.

The attack is a setback for those who need the pack to realign their backs, as well as those who like the sack for holding their Prozac, ice packs and crackerjack.

Black was taken aback and began to fall back to avoid attack, but has said he will not slack after this setback, and will get payback for those who sacked his nymphomaniac power pack sex act.
