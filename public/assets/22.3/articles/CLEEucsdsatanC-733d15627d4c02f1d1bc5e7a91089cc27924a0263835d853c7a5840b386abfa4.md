Satan be with you, ye wrongful creations of California. May the Dark Lord wretchedly smile your way and make you trip on a black cat.

Buuut! All formalities aside, hello, hello! We are finally having a first official Triton Satanic GBM this coming Saturday, because Sunday is when the church people realllllly like to test their new torches and pitchforks out, if you know what I mean.

For all ye first timers, this is the time where we gather to scheme and plan the Satanic overthrow of the world — and enjoy some fun activities we have planned out for you! Also there’s going to be some mean barbeque — don’t worry, it’s not spiked with any funny stuff. Just chili sauce. If we actually wanted to spike something we would have gone for the Kool-aid! Hahaha.

For all ye many-timers! You already know we hold discussions during our evil meetings to really take in to the philosophical area of Satanism. Last meeting’s discussion (before we unfortunately got into a lawsuit with the entire Deep South of the US): “Is the upside down cross a satanic sign? Should we keep using it?” The general consensus, much to Tiffany’s dissent (she’s still not over it), was No! Saint Peter was crucified that way, so technically an upside down cross is a Holy sign.

This meeting’s discussion: “Why is Satan bad if he tortures bad people for all eternity?” Study up! Get ready your papers, cite your sources properly! We may be the Devil’s worshippers, but people who plagiarize are the devil (3).

During or after the meeting, prizes! We will raffle away many satanic, pagan goods and decorations that could be hung on your Christmas trees! I’m going for the bejeweled, glitter-decorated skull of Amelia Earhart. All thanks to the Vaticaaa- I mean an anonymous organization for sponsoring us! Let’s just say we’re not the only ones. Oh and uhh ... FYI, Christmas was copied from a Pagan holiday. Nonono. Go ahead. Google “Is Christmas Pagan?” I’ll wait.
