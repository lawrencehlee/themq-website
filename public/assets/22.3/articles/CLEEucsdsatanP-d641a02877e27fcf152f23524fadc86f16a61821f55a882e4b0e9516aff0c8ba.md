Greetings, children of the Great Shepherd, our Great Lord. I stand before you today with a message warning you to watch out for the great evil that plagued our world since its conception, thousands of years ago (let me remind you Geology majors that you are going against the word of God!).

That warning, my beloved children, is that the entire campus of UCSD is plagued by pagan signs and demonic symbols!

I mean really. Did you not see the Seven Deadly Sins listed right up on the sides of the Charles Powell building?! I mean at that point it’s just poor craftsmanship! I’ve seen finer, subtle work on the one dollar bill!

Also need I remind you about the wretched display of one Sun God? The Second Commandment says all believers have a right to bear arrrI mean Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me! And we all know it really pained God when he wrote this to stop Zeus. Zeus was getting a bit too wild and free with the whole sex thing and God wanted that to stop, okay? It’s not Him, it’s you.

And finally, SIX colleges? If you look at the names of all the colleges, it’s Revelle, Muir, Marshall, ERC, Warren, and Jacobs. Take the mean of those letters, then add one to it, and it comes up as 6.66. Nonono. Go ahead. Whip out a calculator and do the math. And then proceed to whip yourself to repent for using sinful technology.

I’ll wait.
